    # CUSTOM RISK MEASURE: NEGATIVE ENGAGEMENT ANALYSIS
    # ==========================================================================
    # My custom measure is "Negative engagement risk measure" and it analyzes how other users
    # respond to the posts a user creates by giving their reactions. My idea was that sometimes
    # content moderation cannot catch the more hidden profanity and spamming and it may fail 
    # when it deals with more subtle profanity or rudeness. However, users almost always catch 
    # these and react to them. By analyzing those reactions, we can identify even the most
    # subtle and hidden toxic materials on the platform.
    #
    # I assigned a numerical weight to each reaction type and using these weights I quantifies the user's received reactions from other users.  here are the summary of the weights:
    #  - "Angry" is -1 because it means the person who left an angry reaction is showing strong negative emotion. 
    #  - "Sad" is 0 because it is emotionally ambiguous and it can simply show that the user is empathizing with the post. 
    #  - all the happy reactions such as Like, Love, haha, Wow will receive a +1 because they show that the users are appreciating the post and it is less likely to be a bad or violating one. 
    #For each user, I collect all the reactions on their posts and calculate their weighted average. Then, I divide this sum by the total number of reactions to get a normalized ratio that will range between -1 and +1. This "sentiment ratio" shows the average sentiment of the whole community of users interacting with that user's post on our platform. 
    #Finally, I apply risk penalty based on the user's sentiment ratio. a ratio under -0.3 means almost 65 to 70 percent of the users are not happy with the posts and this can be a good trigger.  -0.3 to -0.5 is considered moderate and receives +0.3 to their risk score.  is the sentiment ratio is between -0.5 and -0.7 i add 0.5 to their risk score and if the sentiment ratio is less than -0.7 i add 1 to their risk score.

    # - Spammers mention many users to appear in their notifications which is a violation.
    # - Spammers bypass URL filters by using mentions and attracting people to their profile
    # - This annoys mentioned users who get unwanted notifications
    # - It shows some sort of marketing behavior that is intrusive. 
    #
    # Threshold: 5 mentions or more
    # Normal group conversations might mention up to 3 to 4 people
    # So: "Hey @Sajjad and @Atif, check this out" (2 mentions = OK)
    # 
    # More than 4 mentions is too much and it is suspicious
    # - So: "@user1 @user2 @user3 @user4 @user5 @user6 BUY NOW" (6 mentions = not OK = SPAM!)
    #
    # Scoring:
    # - I add 2 points to be consistent with other moderation rules
    # - I DON'T remove the mentions (users can see who was mentioned)
    # - The increased score flags the post for admin to review in order to make sure
    # the user is spamming or it was just an honest poor taste in mentioning!

    # I first tried to stop counting when a person reaches 5, but then realized that it
